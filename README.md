# Ecommerce Database

### Welcome to our retail ecommerce database! If you're new here, fret not, we'll catch you up to speed! If you ever need a step by step guide, or maybe you're just more of a visual learner, feel free to checkout our [video walkthrough here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wZDBfXouJ72ycf3xlPKEeg1Mix4e_EZk/view?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started:
    First things first, we'll need to set up our connection to the database. Once you're in your terminal, go ahead and type "psql -U postgres" and sign in with your password. Once you've done that, type "\i ./db/schema.sql" to create the connection, then "\q" to exit postgres.

## Adding/View Data:
### To add data, type these commands:
    npm i
    npm run seed
    npm start
This will allow you to connect with Insomnia to the DB!

To edit data, you can hit the different routes to the see/adjust the information inside of the database using CRUD methods.

That's it! You've officially connected and used the database!

Happy coding!
